Now move your frontend files (excluding the frontend folder itself) into the new folder. You can use the mv command:
bash
Copy code
mv * frontend/       # Moves all files from the current directory to the 'frontend' folder
If there are hidden files (like .gitignore, .env, etc.), you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
mv .* frontend/      # Moves hidden files to the 'frontend' folder
This will move all files into the frontend folder, so the folder will now contain your entire frontend code.

(copy .git hidden folder where you want to make it a repository)
